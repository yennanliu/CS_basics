## 📌 **Coach Tips**

✔ Do **timed sessions** like real interviews (45–60 min)
✔ For each problem, write the **solution approach + complexity** in notes
✔ Ask yourself: *Which pattern is this?* — repeat until pattern recognition is automatic ([Reddit][2]).

---

## 🧠 Why This Works

* Builds from basic → advanced topics.
* Daily variety prevents monotony.
* Emphasis on repeating hard problems.
* Encourages mock interviews and timed practice.
