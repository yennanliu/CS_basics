This plan is a high-intensity, pattern-based curriculum designed to take you from your current state to "Google-ready" by your **May 15** interview.

It synthesizes the **15 patterns** from your summary doc and the **"Depth-then-Breadth"** approach from your GPT prep plans.

### **The Strategy**

* **Weeks 1–7 (Depth):** Master one specific pattern per week.
* **Weeks 8–10 (Breadth):** Random "Google-tagged" problems to practice pattern recognition.
* **Weeks 11–12 (Simulation):** Mock interviews and behavioral prep.

### **Daily "Must-Do" Routine**

To align with the `goog_swe_prep_plan_gpt_v2.md` recommendations:

1. **Talk Out Loud:** Never solve in silence. Explain your  and  trade-offs.
2. **No Hint Zone:** Spend at least 30 minutes struggling before checking a solution.
3. **The "Google Follow-up":** After finishing a problem, ask yourself: *"What if the input is too large to fit in memory?"* or *"What if it's a streaming data source?"*

### **Key Problems by Importance (The "All-Star" List)**

If you are short on time, prioritize these 10 (highly cited in your `LC_goog_all.pdf`):

1. **LRU Cache (146)** - Design / Linked List
2. **Trapping Rain Water (42)** - Two Pointers
3. **Number of Islands (200)** - BFS/DFS
4. **Meeting Rooms II (253)** - Intervals/Heaps
5. **Word Break (139)** - DP
6. **Median of Two Sorted Arrays (4)** - Binary Search
7. **Course Schedule II (210)** - Topological Sort
8. **Decode String (394)** - Stack
9. **Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (124)** - Tree/Recursion
10. **Robot Room Cleaner (489)** - Backtracking (Google Classic)
