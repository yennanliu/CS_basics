## Suggested Study Order

For interview prep, learn patterns in this recommended order:

```
Week 1: Sliding Window → Two Pointers → Prefix Sum
Week 2: Binary Search on Answer → Greedy + Sorting
Week 3: Monotonic Stack → Monotonic Deque + DP
Week 4: 1D DP → 2D DP → Bitmask DP
Week 5: BFS + State → Dijkstra → Union Find
Week 6: Tree DFS/BFS → LCA → Rerooting DP
Week 7: Topological Sort → Segment Tree → Heap
Week 8: Trie → KMP → Bit Manipulation → Backtracking
```

Each week: solve 2-3 medium problems + 1-2 hard problems from listed contests.
