# LeetCode Weekly Contest Classics

## Purpose

A curated collection of **classic LeetCode Weekly Contest problems** organized by core algorithm patterns.

**Goal**: Build pattern recognition for *unseen* problems — so when you encounter something new in a contest or interview, you immediately recognize the underlying algorithm.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [classics_by_pattern.md](./classics_by_pattern.md) | Curated contests grouped by core algorithm pattern |
| [contest_index.md](./contest_index.md) | Quick reference index: contest# → pattern |

## How to Use

1. **Pick a pattern** you want to drill (e.g., Monotonic Stack)
2. **Go to that section** in `classics_by_pattern.md`
3. **Solve the medium/hard** from each listed contest
4. **Read the "Why Classic"** note to understand what makes the pattern click
5. **Move to next pattern** after you can identify and code it from scratch

## Key Insight

> "The best way to get comfortable with unseen problems is not to memorize solutions, but to recognize patterns. Each pattern below appears repeatedly in contests — once you *feel* it, you'll spot it in new problems."
