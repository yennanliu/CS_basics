#
# The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.
#
# The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.
#
# By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.
#
# Note:
# The read function will only be called once for each test case.
#

# The read4 API is already defined for you.
# @param buf, a list of characters
# @return an integer
