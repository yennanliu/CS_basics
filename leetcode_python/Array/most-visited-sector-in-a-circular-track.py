1560. Most Visited Sector in a Circular Track
Easy

Given an integer n and an integer array rounds. We have a circular track which consists of n sectors labeled from 1 to n. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. The ith round starts at sector rounds[i - 1] and ends at sector rounds[i]. For example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector rounds[1]

Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The marathon starts at sector 1. The order of the visited sectors is as follows:
1 --> 2 --> 3 (end of round 1) --> 4 --> 1 (end of round 2) --> 2 (end of round 3 and the marathon)
We can see that both sectors 1 and 2 are visited twice and they are the most visited sectors. Sectors 3 and 4 are visited only once.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, rounds = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]
Output: [2]

Example 3:

Input: n = 7, rounds = [1,3,5,7]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100
1 <= m <= 100
rounds.length == m + 1
1 <= rounds[i] <= n
rounds[i] != rounds[i + 1] for 0 <= i < m

# V0
# IDEA : MATH (only the first and the last sector matter)
#
#   every full lap visits all n sectors equally, so the winners are the
#   sectors on the partial arc rounds[0] -> rounds[-1] :
#     - start <= end : the plain range [start .. end]
#     - start >  end : the wrapped arc [1 .. end] + [start .. n]
#   NOTE : the intermediate rounds[i] are irrelevant, they only add
#          whole laps.
#
# time = O(n), space = O(n)
