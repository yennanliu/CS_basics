3653. XOR After Range Multiplication Queries I
Medium

You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D integer array
queries of size q, where queries[i] = [li, ri, ki, vi].

For each query, you must apply the following operations in order:

Set idx = li.

While idx <= ri:

Update: nums[idx] = (nums[idx] * vi) % (10^9 + 7)

Set idx += ki.

Return the bitwise XOR of all elements in nums after processing all queries.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], queries = [[0,2,1,4]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
A single query [0, 2, 1, 4] multiplies every element from index 0 through
index 2 by 4.
The array changes from [1, 1, 1] to [4, 4, 4].
The XOR of all elements is 4 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,5,4], queries = [[1,4,2,3],[0,2,1,2]]
Output: 31
Explanation:
The first query [1, 4, 2, 3] multiplies the elements at indices 1 and 3 by
3, transforming the array to [2, 9, 1, 15, 4].
The second query [0, 2, 1, 2] multiplies the elements at indices 0, 1, and 2
by 2, resulting in [4, 18, 2, 15, 4].
Finally, the XOR of all elements is 4 ^ 18 ^ 2 ^ 15 ^ 4 = 31.

Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^3
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
1 <= q == queries.length <= 10^3
queries[i] = [li, ri, ki, vi]
0 <= li <= ri < n
1 <= ki <= n
1 <= vi <= 10^5

# V0
# IDEA : DIRECT SIMULATION — THE ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION IS SHORT ENOUGH
#
#   one query touches ceil((r - l + 1) / k) cells, which is at most n. with
#   n and q both bounded by 1000 the total work is at most 10^6 modular
#   multiplications, so nothing clever is required (the "II" version raises
#   the bounds and does need a per-k difference trick).
#
#   the only subtlety is that values must stay reduced mod 10^9+7 as the
#   problem prescribes, so the final XOR is taken over the reduced values.
#
# time = O(q * n), space = O(1)
