1701. Average Waiting Time
Medium

There is a restaurant with a single chef. You are given an array customers, where
customers[i] = [arrivali, timei]:

- arrivali is the arrival time of the ith customer. The arrival times are sorted in non-decreasing
  order.
- timei is the time needed to prepare the order of the ith customer.

When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts preparing it once he is
idle. The customer waits till the chef finishes preparing his order. The chef does not prepare food
for more than one customer at a time. The chef prepares food for customers in the order they were
given in the input.

Return the average waiting time of all customers. Solutions within 10^-5 from the actual answer are
considered accepted.


Example 1:

Input: customers = [[1,2],[2,5],[4,3]]
Output: 5.00000
Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 1, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately
at time 1, and finishes at time 3, so the waiting time of the first customer is 3 - 1 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 2, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 3,
and finishes at time 8, so the waiting time of the second customer is 8 - 2 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 4, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 8,
and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the third customer is 11 - 4 = 7.
So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: customers = [[5,2],[5,4],[10,3],[20,1]]
Output: 3.25000
Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately
at time 5, and finishes at time 7, so the waiting time of the first customer is 7 - 5 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 7,
and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the second customer is 11 - 5 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 10, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 11,
and finishes at time 14, so the waiting time of the third customer is 14 - 10 = 4.
4) The fourth customer arrives at time 20, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it
immediately at time 20, and finishes at time 21, so the waiting time of the fourth customer is
21 - 20 = 1.
So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 4 + 1) / 4 = 3.25.


Constraints:

1 <= customers.length <= 10^5
1 <= arrivali, timei <= 10^4
arrivali <= arrivali+1

# IDEA : SINGLE-SERVER FIFO SIMULATION (track when the chef becomes free)

#   orders are cooked strictly in input order, so one running clock `free` is
#   enough: the chef starts customer i at max(free, arrival_i) and finishes
#   `time_i` later.
#     free = max(free, arrival) + cook
#     wait = free - arrival        (arrival -> the moment the dish is done)
#
#   accumulate the waits as an integer sum and divide once at the end to avoid
#   float drift over 10^5 additions.
