1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence
Easy

Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a
searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix
of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index
of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.


Example 1:

Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
Output: 4
Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.

Example 2:

Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
Output: 2
Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in
the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.

Example 3:

Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
Output: -1
Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.


Constraints:

1 <= sentence.length <= 100
1 <= searchWord.length <= 10
sentence consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
searchWord consists of lowercase English letters.
