1367. Linked List in Binary Tree
Medium

Given a binary tree root and a linked list with head as the first node.

Return True if all the elements in the linked list starting from the head correspond to some downward path connected in the binary tree otherwise return False.

In this context downward path means a path that starts at some node and goes downwards.


Example 1:

Input: head = [4,2,8], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: Nodes in blue form a subpath in the binary Tree.

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,4,2,6], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: head = [1,4,2,6,8], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no path in the binary tree that contains all the elements of the linked list from head.


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 2500].
The number of nodes in the list will be in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100 for each node in the linked list and binary tree.

# IDEA : DOUBLE RECURSION (try to "start the match" at every tree node)
#
#  - dfs(head, root) : does the list match a downward path STARTING at root?
#      * head is None      -> whole list consumed  -> True
#      * root is None      -> tree ran out first   -> False
#      * values differ     -> False
#      * else keep going into left OR right child
#
#  - isSubPath itself tries dfs at the current node, else recurses into
#    left / right to try a later starting point.
