# Time : O(logn) = O(32)
# Space: O(1)
#
# Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
#
# For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as
# 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary
# as 00111001011110000010100101000000).
#
# Follow up:
# If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
