/**
 * 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * Hint
 * Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.
 *
 * Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
 * Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
 * Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left).
 * After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
 * Output: [1,3,null,null,2]
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
 * Output: [1]
 * Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].
 * 1 <= Node.val, target <= 1000

         * the current node becomes a new leaf.
         * Only after we've processed children should we check if this node should be deleted.
         *
         * We'd only ever delete original leaves (nodes that were leaves before recursion),
         * but we'd miss nodes that became leaves as a result of deleting their children.

         *
         *  Step-by-step with correct order:
         *
         *   step 1) Call deleteLeafHelper(2) on the lowest 2:
         *
         *      - It's a leaf and equals target → delete → return null
         *
         *   step 2) Move to middle 2:
         *
         *      - After the recursive call, its left child is now null,
         *         so it's a new leaf
         *
         *      - It equals target → delete → return null
         *
         *   step 3) Move to root 1:
         *
         *     - Its left child is now null, so nothing else to delete.
         *
         *
         *
         *  -> ❌ If you check the condition before recursion:
         *     The middle 2 still had a left child when it was checked —
         *     it wouldn't be considered a leaf at that point.
         *     So it wouldn’t be deleted, even though it should’ve been.
