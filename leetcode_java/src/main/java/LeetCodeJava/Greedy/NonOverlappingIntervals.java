 * 435. Non-overlapping Intervals
 * Solved
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 *
 * Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= intervals.length <= 105
 * intervals[i].length == 2
 * -5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104

     *
     * > why NOT sort `1st element (small -> big), then 2nd element (big -> small) ?
     * ---
     *
     * ### ✅ Short Answer:
     *
     * We sort **by end time only** because:
     *
     * > 👉 **To keep the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals,
     *    we always want to keep the interval that ends the earliest.**
      *
     * -> e.g. sort on `2nd element (small -> big) allow us to have
     *         GLOBAL maximum on the `most space` in the future
     *
     * This leaves **the most "space"** for future intervals —
     * a **greedy strategy** that is **provably optimal** for this problem.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ### 🔍 Let’s break it down step by step:
     *
     * #### 🎯 **Your Goal:**
     *
     * Minimize the number of intervals to remove → i.e.,
     * **maximize** the number of non-overlapping intervals to keep.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ### 🧠 The Greedy Insight:
     *
     * Let’s look at two intervals:
     *
     * ```
     * A: [1, 3]
     * B: [2, 5]
     * ```
     *
     * Both overlap. Which one should we keep?
     *
     * * If you **keep A** (ends earlier), you’re more likely to fit more intervals after it.
     * * If you **keep B** (ends later), it blocks future intervals.
     *
     * ✅ So: **prefer intervals that end earlier** → more room for what's next.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ### 💡 Why Not Sort by Start Time?
     *
     * If we sort by start time (like your original logic), you might make **locally suboptimal decisions**.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     * ```java
     * intervals = [[1, 100], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
     * ```
     *
     * If you sort by **start time**, you process `[1, 100]` first and remove the rest.
     *
     * But if you sort by **end time**, you process `[2, 3]`, `[3, 4]`, `[4, 5]` — and only remove `[1, 100]`.
     *
     * ✅ **Result: 3 kept vs. 1 kept** — greedy on end time is clearly better.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ### 📊 Formal Reason (from Algorithm Theory):
     *
     * This problem is a variation of the **Activity Selection Problem** (Interval Scheduling Maximization), where:
     *
     * > Sorting by end time allows a greedy approach to select the maximal number of non-overlapping activities.
     *
     * It's a **well-known optimal greedy strategy** for interval problems in algorithm literature.
     *

     * ### ✍️ Summary Table:
     *
     * | Sort By          | Behavior                                  | Result                               |
     * | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
     * | Start Time (ASC) | Prioritizes early-starting intervals      | Not optimal — may block better ones  |
     * | End Time (ASC) ✅ | Prioritizes short, early-ending intervals | ✅ Optimal — maximizes future options |

        /** NOTE !!!
         *
         *   sort on 2nd element in Ascending order (small -> big)

         *
         *
         *
         *   1) Why Not Sort by Start Time ?
         *
         *    -> If we sorted by the start time (intervals[i][0]),
         *       it would not necessarily minimize the number of intervals to
         *       remove because we wouldn't have the benefit of always selecting the
         *       interval that finishes the earliest, which is crucial for maximizing
         *       the number of non-overlapping intervals.
         *
         *    -> In conclusion, sorting by end time provides the correct and
         *       optimal solution for this problem.
         *
         *
         *  2)  Key Concept:
         *     -> The goal of the problem is to remove the minimum number of intervals to
         *        ensure that no two intervals overlap. To solve this optimally,
         *        sorting by the end time is the preferred approach. This is because:
         *
         *     -> Once you have sorted intervals by their `end time`,
         *        you can greedily choose the intervals that end earliest,
         *        leaving more room for subsequent intervals. This helps you avoid
         *        overlap and minimize the number of intervals you need to remove.
         *
         *
         *  3) Why Sorting by Start Time is Problematic:
         *     -> If you sort by the start time instead of the end time,
         *        you might end up with overlapping intervals that are harder to manage.
