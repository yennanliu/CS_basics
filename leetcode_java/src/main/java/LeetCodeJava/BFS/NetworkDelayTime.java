/**
 *
 * 743. Network Delay Time
 *
 * You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
 *
 * We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1
 * Output: 1
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2
 * Output: -1
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= k <= n <= 100
 * 1 <= times.length <= 6000
 * times[i].length == 3
 * 1 <= ui, vi <= n
 * ui != vi
 * 0 <= wi <= 100
 * All the pairs (ui, vi) are unique. (i.e., no multiple edges.)
