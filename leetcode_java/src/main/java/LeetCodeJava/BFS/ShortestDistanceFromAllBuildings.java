/**
 * 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings
 * You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:
 *
 * Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
 * Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
 * Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
 *
 * 1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
 * |   |   |   |   |
 * 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
 * |   |   |   |   |
 * 0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
 *
 * Output: 7
 *
 * Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
 *              the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total
 *              travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
 * Note:
 * There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.

     * Q:
     *  -------------
     *
     *   how does `visited`  work  in Multi-source BFS ?
     *
     *    -> given the LC 317 as an example:
     *         Input: grid = [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
     *
     *    -> if we start from `1` grid, since we use visited
     *    -> can the BFS visit all  `0` ?
     *       since some 0 already marked as visited,
     *       and they may at the path to visit other `0`  ?
     *
     * -------------
     *
     * Answer:
     *
     *
     * # Understanding BFS Visitation in LC 317
     *
     * To solve **LC 317: Shortest Distance from All Buildings**,
     * we must distinguish between a **Simultaneous Multi-source BFS**
     * and performing **Multiple Independent BFS runs**.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ## 1. The Core Logic
     * In this problem, we need the **sum of distances** from a
     * land cell (`0`) to **ALL** buildings (`1`). Because of this requirement,
     * we cannot run one single multi-source BFS. Instead, we run a separate BFS
     * starting from every building.
     *
     * ### Why each building needs its own "view" of the 0s:
     * * **Building A** needs to know its shortest distance to every `0`.
     * * **Building B** needs to know its shortest distance to every `0`.
     *
     * * If Building A and Building B shared a `visited` array,
     * the first building to "claim" a `0` would prevent the second building
     * from ever calculating its distance to that spot.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ## 2. How `visited` works inside one BFS
     * When we are running BFS for **one specific building**:
     *
     * 1.  **The Ripple Effect:** Imagine dropping a stone in water. The "visited" cells are the ones the ripple has already passed. The ripple doesn't stop; it continues to expand to the neighbors of the visited cell.
     * 2.  **Shortest Path Guarantee:** The `visited` array ensures that when we reach a `0` for the first time, we have found the **absolute shortest path** from the starting building to that land.
     * 3.  **Preventing Infinite Loops:** Without `visited`, the BFS would bounce back and forth between two `0` cells forever.
     *
     *
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ## 3. "Can we visit all 0s if some are already marked?"
     * **Yes.** Within a single BFS run, the fact that a `0` is marked as `visited` doesn't block the search; it simply means that specific cell is now part of the "already processed" group.
     *
     * * Before a cell is marked `visited`, it **adds its neighbors to the queue**.
     * * This ensures the "flow" of the BFS reaches every reachable corner of the grid.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ## 4. Multi-source vs. Many Single-sources
     *
     * | Strategy | Queue Initialization | Visited Logic | Result |
     * | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
     * | **Simultaneous Multi-source** | All buildings added to queue at `dist = 0`. | One shared `visited` array. | Distance to the **nearest** building. |
     * | **Independent BFS (LC 317)** | One building at a time. | **Fresh** `visited` per building. | Sum of distances to **all** buildings. |
     *
     *
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ## 5. Optimized "Visited" Trick (No extra memory)
     * To avoid creating a new `boolean[][]` array for every building, we can use the `grid` values to track which cells are reachable.
     *
     * * **Building 1:** Only walks on `0`s. After visiting, it changes them to `-1`.
     * * **Building 2:** Only walks on `-1`s. After visiting, it changes them to `-2`.
     * * **Building 3:** Only walks on `-2`s.
     *
     * This ensures that if a land cell is blocked and cannot be reached by Building 1, it will never be `-1`, and Building 2 will skip it entirely. This automatically filters out land that cannot reach all buildings.
     *

     *
     * To solve LeetCode 317: Shortest Distance from All Buildings,
     * the most efficient approach is to perform a Breadth-First Search
     * (BFS) starting from each building.
     *
     * Problem Logic
     *
     *  - Perspective:
     *      Instead of checking every empty land (0)
     *      and looking for all buildings (1),
     *      we start from each building and calculate
     *      the distance to all reachable empty land cells.

     *  - Distance
     *     Accumulation: We maintain a totalDistance matrix
     *     to store the sum of distances from all buildings
     *     to each empty cell.
     *
     *  - Reachability:
     *     We maintain a reachCount matrix to track how many
     *     buildings can reach a specific empty cell.
     *     An empty cell is only valid if its reachCount equals
     *     the total number of buildings.
     *
     *  - Optimization (Space & Time):
     *    To avoid resetting a visited array for every BFS,
     *    we can use the grid itself or a mark variable to identify
     *    which empty cells were reachable by the previous building.

     *
     *  Question: Why can we use the same `dist, reachCount`
     *            track all distance, reached count from all different buildings ?
     *            isn't the value being `overwritten` when another cell 1 running BFS ?
     *
     *
     *  ->
     * That is an excellent question! Understanding how the accumulation works is the key to this problem. The values are **not overwritten**; instead, they are **summed up** or **incremented**.
     *
     * Think of the `totalDistance` and `reachCount` matrices as "global scoreboards" that every building contributes to.
     *
     * ### 1. The `totalDistance` Matrix (Accumulation)
     *
     *   - When Building A performs its BFS, it finds every reachable empty land cell `(r, c)`
     *     and calculates the distance. It then **adds** that distance to `totalDistance[r, c]`.
     *
     *   - When Building B starts its BFS, it does the same.
     *     If it reaches the same cell `(r, c)`, it **adds its own
     *     distance** to the value already stored there.
     *
     * * **Building A BFS:** finds `(r, c)` at distance 3. `totalDistance[r, c]` becomes `0 + 3 = 3`.
     * * **Building B BFS:** finds `(r, c)` at distance 5. `totalDistance[r, c]` becomes `3 + 5 = 8`.
     *
     * By the time all buildings have finished their BFS, `totalDistance[r, c]`
     * contains the sum of distances from **all** buildings to that specific piece of land.
     *
     *
     *
     * ### 2. The `reachCount` Matrix (Validation)
     *
     * This matrix tracks how many buildings can "see" a specific cell.
     * Each time a building's BFS reaches an empty cell, it performs `reachCount[r][c]++`.
     *
     * If you have 3 buildings in total, and at the end of the process `reachCount[r][c]`
     * is only `2`, it means one building was blocked by walls or other buildings and
     * could never reach that spot. We use this to filter out invalid landing spots.
     *
     * ### 3. Why the values don't get messed up
     *
     * The only thing that gets "overwritten" or reset is the `visited` array
     * (or the `visited` state). Each building needs its own fresh `visited`
     * check to ensure it calculates the shortest path from *its* specific
     * starting position.
     *
     * However, `totalDistance` and `reachCount` must persist throughout the
     * entire execution because their goal is to provide the **aggregate data**
     * for all buildings.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * **Summary Table of Matrix Roles**
     *
     * | Matrix | Action during BFS | Final Purpose |
     * | --- | --- | --- |
     * | `visited` | Reset for **every** building | Prevents cycles and ensures shortest path for current BFS. |
     * | `reachCount` | **Incremented** (+1) | Ensures the land is reachable by **all** buildings. |
     * | `totalDistance` | **Summed** (+ dist) | Provides the total travel cost for that specific land. |
