 * Solved
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * There are n flights that are labeled from 1 to n.
 *
 * You are given an array of flight bookings bookings, where bookings[i] = [firsti, lasti, seatsi] represents a booking for flights firsti through lasti (inclusive) with seatsi seats reserved for each flight in the range.
 *
 * Return an array answer of length n, where answer[i] is the total number of seats reserved for flight i.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
 * Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
 * Explanation:
 * Flight labels:        1   2   3   4   5
 * Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
 * Booking 2 reserved:      20  20
 * Booking 3 reserved:      25  25  25  25
 * Total seats:         10  55  45  25  25
 * Hence, answer = [10,55,45,25,25]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,2,15]], n = 2
 * Output: [10,25]
 * Explanation:
 * Flight labels:        1   2
 * Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
 * Booking 2 reserved:      15
 * Total seats:         10  25
 * Hence, answer = [10,25]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
 * 1 <= bookings.length <= 2 * 104
 * bookings[i].length == 3
 * 1 <= firsti <= lasti <= n
 * 1 <= seatsi <= 104
