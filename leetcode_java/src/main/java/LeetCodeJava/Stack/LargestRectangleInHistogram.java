 * 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram
 * Solved
 * Hard
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
 * The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: heights = [2,4]
 * Output: 4
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= heights.length <= 105
 * 0 <= heights[i] <= 104

    /**
     *
     * 1) Example Walkthrough:
     *  Letâ€™s say heights = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]:
     *
     * - Start with an empty stack and iterate over the bars.
     * - At each step, check if the current bar is shorter than the one at the top of the stack. If so, pop from the stack, calculate the area of the rectangle that can be formed, and update maxArea.
     * - Once the entire array is processed, clean up the stack by popping any remaining bars and calculating the area they form.
     *
     *
     * 2) Time Complexity:
     * Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram.
     *
     * Each index is pushed and popped from the stack once, so the overall time complexity is linear.
     *
     * 3) Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram.
     *
     * The stack stores at most n indices during the iteration.
     *
     *
     * 4) Key Concepts:
     * Monotonic Stack:
     *    - The stack is maintained in a way that the heights of
     *      the bars indexed in the stack are in increasing order.
     *
     *
     * Area Calculation:
     *    - Every time we pop an element from the stack,
     *     we calculate the area of the rectangle that the popped bar forms.
