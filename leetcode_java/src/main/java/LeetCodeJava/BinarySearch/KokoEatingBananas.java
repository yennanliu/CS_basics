 * 875. Koko Eating Bananas
 * Solved
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
 *
 * Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
 *
 * Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
 *
 * Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
 * Output: 4
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
 * Output: 30
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
 * Output: 23
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= piles.length <= 104
 * piles.length <= h <= 109
 * 1 <= piles[i] <= 109

    /**
     * Example Walkthrough:
     *
     * Let's say the piles are [3, 6, 7, 11] and h = 8.
     *
     * - Initially, l = 1 and r = 11 (largest pile).
     *
     * - After checking mid = 6, we find that it's
     *   valid to finish the piles in 8 hours, so we reduce r = mid - 1 = 5.
     *
     * - Next, mid = 3 results in needing more than 8 hours,
     *   so we increase l = mid + 1 = 4.
     *
     * - Eventually, when l = 4 and r = 4,
     *   we find that 4 is the minimum valid eating speed.
     *
     *
     * -> The binary search narrows down the possibilities, and at the end, l holds the smallest valid speed.
     *
     *
     *
     * In Summary:
     *
     * The binary search finds the smallest valid eating speed that satisfies the condition.
     * After the search completes, l holds the minimum eating speed, so we return l.

         *  Why Return l?
         *
         *  - After the binary search, l will be the smallest speed
         *    that can finish all piles in h hours.
         *
         *
         *  - When r < l, it means the smallest valid eating speed is l. Here's why:
         *
         *      - When r becomes less than l, it means the search has narrowed down
         *        to the smallest valid speed, which is l.
         *
         *      - In the binary search, the left pointer l is adjusted when
         *        the current speed (mid) is found to be valid (i.e., we can complete
         *        the piles in h hours). So, by the end of the search,
         *        l will have the smallest possible speed that allows us to
         *        complete the piles within the given time h.
         *
         *
         *  Why Not Return r?
         *
         *    - Returning r would return the largest speed that was valid during the search,
         *      but we want the smallest speed that is still valid. In the binary search,
         *      when the loop terminates, l will be the smallest speed that fulfills the condition,
         *      and r will have passed below l.
         *
         *    - At the point where r < l, the smallest valid speed will be l, not r,
         *      because r will be one step behind l.
