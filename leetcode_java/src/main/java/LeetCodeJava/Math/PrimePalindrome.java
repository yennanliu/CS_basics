/**
 * 866. Prime Palindrome
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * Given an integer n, return the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to n.
 *
 * An integer is prime if it has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. Note that 1 is not a prime number.
 *
 * For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are all primes.
 * An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.
 *
 * For example, 101 and 12321 are palindromes.
 * The test cases are generated so that the answer always exists and is in the range [2, 2 * 108].
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 6
 * Output: 7
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 8
 * Output: 11
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 13
 * Output: 101
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 108
 *
