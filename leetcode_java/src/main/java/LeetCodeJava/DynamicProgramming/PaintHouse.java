/**
 * 256. Paint House
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 *
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 *
 * Note:
 * All costs are positive integers.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
 *              Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
 * Difficulty:
 * Easy
