# Coding Interview Cheatsheet In General

## Answering Steps 
- 1) Understand the questions (requirement, IO, accepted form)
- 2) Ask the 
	- scope 
		- scale of data
		- range of number
	- limitation
		- boundary of the questions
		- expected space & time compliexity
- 3) Come up with V1 approaches
	- Algorithm ideas 
	- brute force is fine, but explain the ideas
	- come up with V2 solutions, explain the ideas, the Algorithm & data structure
	- Write pseudo code 
	- Discuss the edge cases
	- Discuss with interviewer, if OK, start coding 
- 4) Write the code
	- clean code, explain, easy-to-understand variable names
	- write `test cases`
- 5) Run the code 
	- solve bugs
	- Explain time & space complexity
	- validate the test cases
- 6) Following up session 
	- optimize time & space complexity
	- if input is scalable
	- if input is in stream (rather than batch)
	- if input can not fit the server memory
