# Quick Comparison: Topological Sort vs Quick Union

| Feature | Topological Sort | Quick Union (Disjoint Set Union) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Purpose | **Order nodes** respecting dependency (**DAGs** only) | **Find connected components** and **detect cycles** (**undirected graphs**) |
| Works on | **Directed graphs (DAGs)** | **Undirected graphs** |
| Detects cycle? | ✅ (if cannot topologically sort, cycle detected) | ✅ (when two nodes already share a parent, cycle detected) |
| Handles direction of edges? | ✅ (Direction matters: `u ➔ v`) | ❌ (Ignores direction: just connected or not) |
| Output | Ordered list of nodes (`[u, v, w]`) | Connected components or cycle detection |
| Common Use Cases | Course scheduling, build systems, dependency resolution | Kruskal's MST, dynamic connectivity, union-find problems |
| Time Complexity | O(V + E) | Nearly O(1) per operation (amortized with path compression) |
| Space Complexity | O(V + E) | O(V) |

# ⚙️ Algorithm Core Ideas

## ➔ Topological Sort (for DAGs)
- Think **assembly line**:  
  - Can't assemble a car until frame is ready.
- Process nodes with no incoming edges first.
- If you ever get stuck (nodes still left but no "zero indegree" node), **cycle detected**.

Two common ways:
- **BFS** with indegree array.
- **DFS** with recursion + post-order.

## ➔ Quick Union (Disjoint Set Union)
- Think **friend groups**:
  - If Alice knows Bob, Bob knows Charlie → one group.
- Each node points to a *parent*.
- If two nodes already have the same root → **cycle detected** (for undirected graphs).
- Heavily optimized with:
  - **Path Compression** (flatten tree during find)
  - **Union by Rank/Size** (attach smaller tree under larger one)

# 🚀 Visual Example

Imagine the same input:

```
Courses: 0 -> 1 -> 2
```

| | Topological Sort | Quick Union |
|:-|:-|:-|
| What happens? | Outputs [0, 1, 2] (order matters) | Simply groups them together (connection matters, not order) |
| Why? | Because 0 must finish before 1, and 1 before 2 | Only cares that they're connected |
| Cycle detection? | If a back edge exists (e.g., 2 ➔ 0) → **cycle** | If trying to connect two nodes already connected → **cycle** |

# 🧪 Analogy

- **Topological Sort** is like **building a skyscraper**:  
  - Must finish floors **bottom-up** respecting the order.

- **Quick Union** is like **finding clusters of friends**:  
  - Doesn't matter who talked first, just find connected groups.
