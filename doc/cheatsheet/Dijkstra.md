# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview
**Dijkstra's algorithm** is a greedy algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with `NON-NEGATIVE` edge weights. It finds the shortest path from a starting node (source) to all other nodes in the graph.

### Key Properties
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V) with binary heap, O(V²) with array
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for distance array and visited set
- **Core Idea**: Greedily select the unvisited node with minimum distance
- **When to Use**: Single-source shortest path with non-negative weights
- **Limitation**: `Cannot` handle `negative` edge weights

### Core Characteristics
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Always selects the minimum distance node
- **Priority Queue**: Uses min-heap for efficient minimum extraction
- **Relaxation**: Updates distances when shorter paths are found
- **Finalization**: Once visited, a node's distance is optimal

### 2-2) Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

```python
# LC 787 Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
# V1
# IDEA : Dijkstra
# https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/discuss/267200/Python-Dijkstra
# IDEA
# -> To implement Dijkstra, we need a priority queue to pop out the lowest weight node for next search. In this case, the weight would be the accumulated flight cost. So my node takes a form of (cost, src, k). cost is the accumulated cost, src is the current node's location, k is stop times we left as we only have at most K stops. I also convert edges to an adjacent list based graph g.
# -> Use a vis array to maintain visited nodes to avoid loop. vis[x] record the remaining steps to reach x with the lowest cost. If vis[x] >= k, then no need to visit that case (start from x with k steps left) as a better solution has been visited before (more remaining step and lower cost as heappopped beforehand). And we should initialize vis[x] to 0 to ensure visit always stop at a negative k.
# -> Once k is used up (k == 0) or vis[x] >= k, we no longer push that node x to our queue. Once a popped cost is our destination, we get our lowest valid cost.
# -> For Dijkstra, there is not need to maintain a best cost for each node since it's kind of greedy search. It always chooses the lowest cost node for next search. So the previous searched node always has a lower cost and has no chance to be updated. The first time we pop our destination from our queue, we have found the lowest cost to our destination.

### 2-3) Path With Minimum Effort

    if (heights == null || heights.length == 0)

  /**  NOTE !!!  need `visited, to NOT revisited visited cells (`Dijkstra algo`)
   *
   *   Reason:
   *
   *
   *   Great question — and you’re absolutely right to raise this.
   *
   * ✅ Short Answer:
   *
   * Yes, in Dijkstra’s algorithm for the “minimum effort path” problem,
   * we still need a visited check — but only after the shortest
   * effort to a cell has been finalized.
   *
   * That is:
   *    •   Once we’ve popped a cell (x, y) from the priority queue,
   *        the effort it took to reach it is `guaranteed` to be `minimal`,
   *        due to how the min-heap works.
   *
   *    •   After that point, there’s `NO need` to `revisit` that cell —
   *        any future path that reaches (x, y) will have equal or greater effort,
   *        and can be safely ignored.
   *
   * This is different from classic BFS where all edges are equal weight —
   * but in Dijkstra, this greedy behavior is valid and optimal.
   *
   * ⸻
   *
   * 🤔 Why Not Revisit?
   *
   * Let’s break it down:
   *
   * In Dijkstra:
   *    •   The min-heap (priority queue) guarantees that we always expand the least effort path so far.
   *    •   If a cell is reached for the first time, it’s the best effort you’ll ever see to reach it.
   *    •   If you allow revisiting, you’ll reprocess worse paths and slow down the algorithm.
   *
   * ⸻
   *
   * 📌 Exception:
   *
   * If you were doing plain BFS with no heap, or non-Dijkstra variants,
   * you’d need to revisit when a better cost is found later (like in Bellman-Ford).
   * But with Dijkstra and a correct min-heap structure,
   * no revisits are necessary after finalization.
   *
   * ⸻
   *
   * ✅ Key Rule:
   *
   * In Dijkstra:
   * Once you pop a node (x, y) from the min-heap and mark it visited,
   * you do not need to revisit it — its shortest (or in this case, minimum effort) path is finalized.
   *

### 2-4) Minimum Obstacle Removal to Reach Corner

```java
// java
// LC 2290

// V0-1
// IDEA: Dijkstra's Algorithm (fixed by gpt)
/**
 *  NOTE !!!
 *
 * ✅ Summary:
 *  •   Single cost var won’t work → need dist[][] to track per-cell minimum cost.
 *  •   No explicit visited needed → the dist[][] + early skip (if (cost > dist[y][x]) continue) handles that.
 *
 */
public int minimumObstacles(int[][] grid) {
    if (grid == null || grid.length == 0 || grid[0].length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    int m = grid.length; // rows
    int n = grid[0].length; // cols

    /**
     *   NOTE !!!
     *
     *    we need a 2D array to save the cost when BFS loop over the grid
     *    (CAN'T just use a single var (cost))
     *
     * ---
     *
     * 1. Why keep a dist[][] array instead of a single cost variable?
     *
     *
     *  •   The minimum cost to reach a cell (x,y) is not unique across the grid.
     *  •   For example, you might reach (2,2) with cost 3 via one path, but later find a better path with cost 2.
     *  •   If you only had a single global cost variable, you couldn’t distinguish the costs of different cells — you’d lose information.
     *
     * That’s why:
     *  •   dist[y][x] keeps track of the best cost found so far for each specific cell.
     *  •   Dijkstra works by always expanding the lowest-cost node next, and updating neighbors only if we find a cheaper path.
     *
     * Without dist[][], you’d either:
     *  •   Revisit nodes unnecessarily (potential infinite loops), or
     *  •   Miss better paths (return wrong result).
     */

        Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    }
    dist[0][0] = 0;

    // PQ stores [cost, x, y]
    PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
    pq.offer(new int[] { 0, 0, 0 }); // start at (0,0) with cost=0

    int[][] moves = { { 1, 0 }, { -1, 0 }, { 0, 1 }, { 0, -1 } };

        if (x == n - 1 && y == m - 1) {
            return cost;
        }

        // Skip if we already found better
        /**
         *  NOTE !!!
         *
         *   why DON'T need to maintain a `visited` var
         *   to prevent repeating visit ?
         *
         *  -----
         *
         *   2. Why no explicit visited array?
         *
         * This is subtle. In Dijkstra:
         *  •   A node is considered “visited” (finalized) once it’s dequeued from the priority queue with its minimum cost.
         *  •   Because of the if (cost > dist[y][x]) continue; check, we automatically ignore revisits that don’t improve cost.
         *
         *
         *  So, the role of visited is effectively played by:

         *   This guarantees:
         *  •   The first time you pop a cell with its minimum cost, you expand it.
         *  •   If another path later tries to reach the same cell with a higher cost, it gets ignored.
         *
         * 👉 That’s why visited isn’t needed in Dijkstra — the dist[][] array + priority queue ensure correctness.

### When to Use Each Algorithm

```
Shortest Path Algorithm Selection:

1. What type of problem?
   ├── All-pairs shortest path? → Continue to 2
   │   ├── Small graph (V ≤ 400)? → Use Floyd-Warshall
   │   └── Large graph? → Run Dijkstra V times (or Johnson's algorithm)
   │

2. Are edge weights non-negative?
   ├── YES → Use Dijkstra (most efficient)
   │   ├── Sparse graph? → Dijkstra with binary heap: O((V+E) log V)
   │   └── Dense graph? → Consider array-based: O(V²)
   │
   └── NO (has negative weights) → Use Bellman-Ford
       └── Need cycle detection? → Bellman-Ford explicitly detects

3. Special cases:
   ├── Unweighted graph? → Use BFS: O(V+E)
   ├── Tree structure? → Use DFS/BFS: O(V)
   ├── Grid-based? → Dijkstra on implicit graph
   └── Transitive closure? → Floyd-Warshall (boolean variant)
```

### Practical Comparison Examples

**Example 1: Social Network (1000 users, 5000 friendships)**
- **Single-source (find distances from one user):**
  - Dijkstra: ~5000 × log(1000) ≈ 50,000 operations ⚡ **Best choice**
  - Bellman-Ford: 1000 × 5000 = 5,000,000 operations
  - Floyd-Warshall: 1000³ = 1,000,000,000 operations

- **All-pairs (distances between all users):**
  - Dijkstra × V: 50,000 × 1000 = 50,000,000 operations ⚡ **Best choice**
  - Floyd-Warshall: 1,000,000,000 operations (simpler code)

**Example 2: Small Complete Graph (50 nodes, fully connected)**
- **All-pairs shortest paths:**
  - Floyd-Warshall: 50³ = 125,000 operations ⚡ **Best choice** (simplest)
  - Dijkstra × V: ~2500 × log(50) × 50 = ~500,000 operations

**Example 3: Currency Exchange with Arbitrage Detection**
- **Detect negative cycles (arbitrage opportunities):**
  - Bellman-Ford: O(V·E) ⚡ **Best choice** (explicitly detects)
  - Floyd-Warshall: O(V³), checks diagonal (works for all-pairs)
  - Dijkstra: ❌ Cannot handle negative weights

## Summary & Quick Reference

### Complexity Quick Reference
| Implementation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| Array-based | O(V²) | O(V) | Good for dense graphs |
| Binary Heap | O((V+E)logV) | O(V) | Most common |
| Fibonacci Heap | O(E + VlogV) | O(V) | Theoretical best |
| Grid-based | O(RC log(RC)) | O(RC) | R=rows, C=cols |

### Template Quick Reference
| Template | Best For | Key Code Pattern |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Basic | Standard shortest path | `heapq.heappop(pq)` → relax edges |
| Constrained | K-stops, budget limits | Track state: `(cost, node, constraint)` |
| Grid | 2D matrix problems | 4-directional movement |
| Multi-Source | Multiple starting points | Initialize all sources |
| Bidirectional | Large graphs | Search from both ends |

### Common Patterns & Tricks

#### **Priority Queue State**
```python
# Basic state
(distance, node)

# With constraints
(cost, node, stops_remaining)

# Grid problems
(cost, row, col)

# With path tracking
(distance, node, path)
```

#### **Visited Set Optimization**
```python
# Option 1: Check after pop (recommended)
if node in visited:
    continue
visited.add(node)

# Option 2: Check distance
if d > dist[node]:
    continue
```

#### **Path Reconstruction**
```python
parent = {}
# During relaxation:
parent[v] = u

# Reconstruct path:
path = []
while node != source:
    path.append(node)
    node = parent[node]
path.reverse()
```

### Problem-Solving Steps
1. **Identify graph structure**: Explicit edges or implicit (grid)?
2. **Check constraints**: Non-negative weights? Single source?
3. **Choose template**: Basic, constrained, grid, or multi-source?
4. **Define state**: What needs tracking in priority queue?
5. **Implement relaxation**: How to update distances?
6. **Handle termination**: When to stop? Return what value?

### Common Mistakes & Tips

**🚫 Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to check if already visited
- Using Dijkstra with negative weights
- Not using priority queue (using regular queue)
- Incorrect state comparison in constrained problems
- Not handling disconnected components

**✅ Best Practices:**
- Always use min-heap for priority queue
- Track visited nodes to avoid reprocessing
- Initialize distances to infinity except source
- Consider using distance array vs visited set
- Handle edge cases (empty graph, no path)

### Interview Tips
1. **Clarify constraints**: Always ask about negative weights
2. **State complexity**: Mention time/space complexity upfront
3. **Explain relaxation**: Core concept of updating distances
4. **Consider alternatives**: Mention when BFS or Bellman-Ford better
5. **Optimize if needed**: Discuss bidirectional search for large graphs
