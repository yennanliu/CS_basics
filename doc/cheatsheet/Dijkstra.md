# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview
**Dijkstra's algorithm** is a greedy algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. It finds the shortest path from a starting node (source) to all other nodes in the graph.

### Key Properties
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V) with binary heap, O(VÂ²) with array
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for distance array and visited set
- **Core Idea**: Greedily select the unvisited node with minimum distance
- **When to Use**: Single-source shortest path with non-negative weights
- **Limitation**: Cannot handle negative edge weights

### Core Characteristics
- **Greedy Algorithm**: Always selects the minimum distance node
- **Priority Queue**: Uses min-heap for efficient minimum extraction
- **Relaxation**: Updates distances when shorter paths are found
- **Finalization**: Once visited, a node's distance is optimal

# V0 
# IDEA : Dijkstra
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, times, N, K):
        K -= 1
        nodes = collections.defaultdict(list)

```

### 2-2) Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

```python
# LC 787 Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
# V1
# IDEA : Dijkstra
# https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/discuss/267200/Python-Dijkstra
# IDEA
# -> To implement Dijkstra, we need a priority queue to pop out the lowest weight node for next search. In this case, the weight would be the accumulated flight cost. So my node takes a form of (cost, src, k). cost is the accumulated cost, src is the current node's location, k is stop times we left as we only have at most K stops. I also convert edges to an adjacent list based graph g.
# -> Use a vis array to maintain visited nodes to avoid loop. vis[x] record the remaining steps to reach x with the lowest cost. If vis[x] >= k, then no need to visit that case (start from x with k steps left) as a better solution has been visited before (more remaining step and lower cost as heappopped beforehand). And we should initialize vis[x] to 0 to ensure visit always stop at a negative k.
# -> Once k is used up (k == 0) or vis[x] >= k, we no longer push that node x to our queue. Once a popped cost is our destination, we get our lowest valid cost.
# -> For Dijkstra, there is not need to maintain a best cost for each node since it's kind of greedy search. It always chooses the lowest cost node for next search. So the previous searched node always has a lower cost and has no chance to be updated. The first time we pop our destination from our queue, we have found the lowest cost to our destination.
import collections
import math
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n, flights, src, dst, K):
        graph = collections.defaultdict(dict)
        for s, d, w in flights:
            graph[s][d] = w
        pq = [(0, src, K+1)]
        vis = [0] * n
        while pq:

### 2-3) Path With Minimum Effort

```java
// java
// LC 1631

// V0-1
// IDEA: Dijkstra's ALGO ( fixed by gpt) : min PQ + BFS
public int minimumEffortPath_0_1(int[][] heights) {
    if (heights == null || heights.length == 0)
        return 0;

    int rows = heights.length;
    int cols = heights[0].length;

    // Min-heap: [effort, x, y]
    PriorityQueue<int[]> minPQ = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
    minPQ.offer(new int[] { 0, 0, 0 }); // effort, x, y

    boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];
    int[][] directions = { { 0, 1 }, { 0, -1 }, { 1, 0 }, { -1, 0 } };

  /**  NOTE !!!  need `visited, to NOT revisited visited cells (`Dijkstra algo`)
   *
   *   Reason:
   *
   *
   *   Great question â and youâre absolutely right to raise this.
   *
   * â Short Answer:
   *
   * Yes, in Dijkstraâs algorithm for the âminimum effort pathâ problem,
   * we still need a visited check â but only after the shortest
   * effort to a cell has been finalized.
   *
   * That is:
   *    â¢   Once weâve popped a cell (x, y) from the priority queue,
   *        the effort it took to reach it is `guaranteed` to be `minimal`,
   *        due to how the min-heap works.
   *
   *    â¢   After that point, thereâs `NO need` to `revisit` that cell â
   *        any future path that reaches (x, y) will have equal or greater effort,
   *        and can be safely ignored.
   *
   * This is different from classic BFS where all edges are equal weight â
   * but in Dijkstra, this greedy behavior is valid and optimal.
   *
   * â¸»
   *
   * ð¤ Why Not Revisit?
   *
   * Letâs break it down:
   *
   * In Dijkstra:
   *    â¢   The min-heap (priority queue) guarantees that we always expand the least effort path so far.
   *    â¢   If a cell is reached for the first time, itâs the best effort youâll ever see to reach it.
   *    â¢   If you allow revisiting, youâll reprocess worse paths and slow down the algorithm.
   *
   * â¸»
   *
   * ð Exception:
   *
   * If you were doing plain BFS with no heap, or non-Dijkstra variants,
   * youâd need to revisit when a better cost is found later (like in Bellman-Ford).
   * But with Dijkstra and a correct min-heap structure,
   * no revisits are necessary after finalization.
   *
   * â¸»
   *
   * â Key Rule:
   *
   * In Dijkstra:
   * Once you pop a node (x, y) from the min-heap and mark it visited,
   * you do not need to revisit it â its shortest (or in this case, minimum effort) path is finalized.
   *

## Summary & Quick Reference

### Complexity Quick Reference
| Implementation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| Array-based | O(VÂ²) | O(V) | Good for dense graphs |
| Binary Heap | O((V+E)logV) | O(V) | Most common |
| Fibonacci Heap | O(E + VlogV) | O(V) | Theoretical best |
| Grid-based | O(RC log(RC)) | O(RC) | R=rows, C=cols |

### Template Quick Reference
| Template | Best For | Key Code Pattern |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Basic | Standard shortest path | `heapq.heappop(pq)` â relax edges |
| Constrained | K-stops, budget limits | Track state: `(cost, node, constraint)` |
| Grid | 2D matrix problems | 4-directional movement |
| Multi-Source | Multiple starting points | Initialize all sources |
| Bidirectional | Large graphs | Search from both ends |

### Common Patterns & Tricks

#### **Priority Queue State**
```python
# Basic state
(distance, node)

# With constraints
(cost, node, stops_remaining)

# Grid problems
(cost, row, col)

# With path tracking
(distance, node, path)
```

#### **Visited Set Optimization**
```python
# Option 1: Check after pop (recommended)
if node in visited:
    continue
visited.add(node)

# Option 2: Check distance
if d > dist[node]:
    continue
```

#### **Path Reconstruction**
```python
parent = {}
# During relaxation:
parent[v] = u

# Reconstruct path:
path = []
while node != source:
    path.append(node)
    node = parent[node]
path.reverse()
```

### Problem-Solving Steps
1. **Identify graph structure**: Explicit edges or implicit (grid)?
2. **Check constraints**: Non-negative weights? Single source?
3. **Choose template**: Basic, constrained, grid, or multi-source?
4. **Define state**: What needs tracking in priority queue?
5. **Implement relaxation**: How to update distances?
6. **Handle termination**: When to stop? Return what value?

### Common Mistakes & Tips

**ð« Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to check if already visited
- Using Dijkstra with negative weights
- Not using priority queue (using regular queue)
- Incorrect state comparison in constrained problems
- Not handling disconnected components

**â Best Practices:**
- Always use min-heap for priority queue
- Track visited nodes to avoid reprocessing
- Initialize distances to infinity except source
- Consider using distance array vs visited set
- Handle edge cases (empty graph, no path)

### Interview Tips
1. **Clarify constraints**: Always ask about negative weights
2. **State complexity**: Mention time/space complexity upfront
3. **Explain relaxation**: Core concept of updating distances
4. **Consider alternatives**: Mention when BFS or Bellman-Ford better
5. **Optimize if needed**: Discuss bidirectional search for large graphs
