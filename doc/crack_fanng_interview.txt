I recently spoke with a Senior Engineer whose resume reads like a tech dream team: Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft. Since starting at Amazon in 2015, he’s cracked every FAANG interview that matters—and he shared his best advice for mastering Leetcode in 2025.

I asked: “What’s the smartest way to tackle Leetcode now?”
His answers flipped my approach on its head:

1. Stop Treating Leetcode Like a Checklist

Forget aiming for 1,000 problems. The real skill isn’t in brute force—it’s in pattern recognition.
Know the classic techniques: sliding window, backtracking, two pointers, tree traversals, etc.
Each pattern is a skeleton key that unlocks a dozen problems.
Your superpower: Spot the pattern at a glance and know exactly when to deploy it.

2. Master the DNA of Data Structures

Before you even open Leetcode, build a deep understanding of core data structures—arrays, hashmaps, trees, heaps, graphs.
Don’t just memorize how to use them—know how they work under the hood.
What are their strengths? What breaks them? Where do they shine in the real world?
Write your own LinkedList, Stack, or Trie from scratch at least once. You’ll never forget how they tick.

3. Think Like a Problem Architect, Not a Problem Solver

The best engineers don’t rush to code. They pause.
Spend those first 5–10 minutes breaking down the problem:
What are the constraints?
What edge cases could trip me up?
What’s the brute-force approach? Where can I optimize?
Sketch diagrams. Talk your thoughts out loud.

In interviews, your ability to communicate and reason through a solution is more valuable than simply reaching the answer.

4. Make Your Struggles Your Superpower

Grinding easy problems feels productive, but it’s a trap.
Instead, mix it up:
Start with a warm-up problem you know.
Tackle 2–3 new medium-level, pattern-focused questions.
Always challenge yourself with a hard problem—even if you fail.

Keep a “mistake log.” Track the patterns, edge cases, or tricks that stumped you. Review it weekly. Your biggest leaps come from where you struggled most.

5. Build a Playbook of Tradeoffs

For every technique, document:
Time and space complexity
When does this approach break down?
When is something else faster, cleaner, or safer?

Developing this “when-to-use-what” intuition is what separates Leetcode grinders from true engineers.

TL;DR:
Anyone can solve problems. The best engineers see patterns, understand tradeoffs, and never stop learning from their mistakes.
Don’t just grind Leetcode. Level up your approach to thinking about problems.
