how to optimize a SQL query ? how to do such via `execution plan`?

‚∏ª

‚úÖ What is an Execution Plan?

An execution plan (or query plan) is a breakdown of how the database engine executes a SQL query ‚Äî including join order, index usage, table scan, and estimated cost.

You can get it via:
	‚Ä¢	EXPLAIN (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
	‚Ä¢	EXPLAIN ANALYZE (PostgreSQL ‚Äì includes runtime)
	‚Ä¢	EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON (MySQL ‚Äì detailed plan)
	‚Ä¢	SQL Server: View actual plan in SSMS

‚∏ª

üîç Steps to Optimize via Execution Plan

1. Identify Costly Operations
	‚Ä¢	Look for:
	‚Ä¢	Full Table Scans instead of Index Scans
	‚Ä¢	Nested Loop Joins on large datasets
	‚Ä¢	Sort operations or Hash Aggregates
	‚Ä¢	Temp table / disk usage

2. Check Index Usage
	‚Ä¢	Ensure:
	‚Ä¢	WHERE conditions and JOINs use indexed columns
	‚Ä¢	Composite indexes are aligned with column order
	‚Ä¢	Fix:
	‚Ä¢	Add missing indexes
	‚Ä¢	Remove unused/inefficient ones
	‚Ä¢	Use INDEX HINTS if optimizer is suboptimal

3. ** Avoid SELECT *** (wide rows)
	‚Ä¢	Only retrieve the columns needed, to reduce I/O.

4. Analyze Join Order
	‚Ä¢	Optimizer chooses join order, but you can improve by:
	‚Ä¢	Rewriting subqueries to JOINs
	‚Ä¢	Using CTEs to isolate expensive branches
	‚Ä¢	Pushing filters before joins

5. Refactor WHERE/HAVING Clauses
	‚Ä¢	Ensure predicates are:
	‚Ä¢	Sargable (Search Argument-able): avoid WHERE YEAR(date_col) = 2023
	‚Ä¢	Use explicit joins instead of correlated subqueries

6. Check for Over-Aggressive GROUP BY / ORDER BY
	‚Ä¢	Index columns used in GROUP BY, ORDER BY
	‚Ä¢	Add covering indexes if repeated often

‚∏ª

## üõ† Example (MySQL)

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;

Look for:
	‚Ä¢	type should be ref or index
	‚Ä¢	key should not be NULL
	‚Ä¢	rows should be low

If type=ALL, and key=NULL ‚áí full table scan ‚Üí Add index on customer_id.

‚∏ª

üìå Summary

Optimization Focus	Via Execution Plan
Index usage	Check key, rows, type
Join efficiency	Avoid nested loops on large data
Table scans	Look for type=ALL
Sort/aggregation cost	Watch for filesort / temporary table
Filter effectiveness	Ensure filters are early in plan

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk through a realistic SQL optimization scenario using an EXPLAIN plan. I‚Äôll cover:

‚∏ª

üîç Scenario: You have this query:

SELECT o.id, o.order_date, c.name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
WHERE o.status = 'shipped' AND c.region = 'US'
ORDER BY o.order_date DESC
LIMIT 100;


‚∏ª

üîé Step 1: Run EXPLAIN (MySQL / PostgreSQL syntax similar)

EXPLAIN SELECT o.id, o.order_date, c.name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
WHERE o.status = 'shipped' AND c.region = 'US'
ORDER BY o.order_date DESC
LIMIT 100;


‚∏ª

üìã Step 2: Understand the Key Metrics in Execution Plan

Metric	What It Means	Ideal Value / Issue to Watch For
type	Access method (ALL, index, ref, eq_ref)	‚úÖ Prefer ref or eq_ref over ALL (full scan)
key	Index being used	‚ùó If NULL, no index is used
rows	Estimated rows scanned	‚úÖ Lower is better
filtered	Percentage of rows passed to next stage	‚ùó Low = bad filter effectiveness
Extra	Additional info (Using temporary, filesort)	‚ùó ‚ÄúUsing temporary‚Äù or ‚Äúfilesort‚Äù = slow


‚∏ª

üß™ Sample EXPLAIN Output (MySQL-like):

id	table	type	key	rows	Extra
1	customers	ALL	NULL	100000	Using where; Using join buffer
1	orders	ref	idx_customer_id	1000	Using where; Using filesort


‚∏ª

üö® Problems Found
	1.	customers is doing a full table scan
	‚Ä¢	key = NULL, type = ALL ‚Üí no index on region
	2.	orders is using filesort
	‚Ä¢	ORDER BY o.order_date not covered by index

‚∏ª

‚úÖ How to Improve the SQL

üîß Step 1: Add Missing Indexes

-- Add index to speed up customer filter
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_region ON customers(region);

-- Add compound index for better sort and filter
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_date ON orders(status, order_date DESC);

üí° Optional: Use Covering Index if needed

If the query often runs with just a few columns:

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_covering ON orders(status, order_date DESC, customer_id, id);


‚∏ª

üí¨ After Optimization: Re-run EXPLAIN

Expected improvements:

Metric	Expected Fix
type	ref or range instead of ALL
key	Non-NULL, showing your new index
rows	Reduced significantly
Extra	No filesort, temporary, or join buffer


‚∏ª

‚úÖ General Tips

Symptom	Fix
ALL in type	Add index to WHERE / JOIN columns
filesort in Extra	Add index matching ORDER BY
Using temporary in Extra	Rewrite query or add index
High rows count	Rewrite logic or split into subqueries
Poor filter % (filtered < 30%)	Improve WHERE clause or pre-filter in app logic

Great! Let‚Äôs dive deeper by showing how to use EXPLAIN ANALYZE (PostgreSQL) or EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON (MySQL) for an even more insightful SQL performance diagnosis.

‚∏ª

## Example in PostgreSQL

Suppose this query is slow:

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'shipped' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100;

You run:

EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'shipped' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100;

You‚Äôll get output like:

Limit  (cost=0.43..12.59 rows=100 width=124)
  ->  Index Scan using idx_orders_status_created on orders  (cost=0.43..4320.85 rows=34345 width=124)
        Index Cond: (status = 'shipped')

‚úÖ Good Signs:
	‚Ä¢	Uses Index Scan instead of Seq Scan
	‚Ä¢	Uses Index Cond, meaning index is applied
	‚Ä¢	Reasonable cost and row estimate

‚∏ª

üîç What You Should Look for in EXPLAIN ANALYZE

üîé Clue	üìå What to Check / Improve
Seq Scan	Create index on the filter column(s)
Sort Method: external	Increase work_mem or index on ORDER BY column
Rows Removed by Filter	Indicates filtering happening after scan ‚Äî try moving to index
Loops > 1	Often means nested loop ‚Äî check for better join strategies
High Actual Time	Look at step-by-step time, see if sort/join steps dominate
Rows Planned ‚â† Actual	Bad estimate ‚Äî consider running ANALYZE or tuning planner stats


‚∏ª

üöÄ Quick Fix Checklist for SQL Optimization

Problem	Fix
Slow join	Index the joined columns (JOIN ON ...)
Slow ORDER BY	Add index on sorted column, especially with LIMIT
Low selectivity (filtered = low)	Avoid OR, use UNION, or refactor query
Big data reads	Consider query partitioning, caching, or materialized views
High CPU due to sort/temp files	Add LIMIT, rewrite query, or adjust Postgres configs


‚∏ª

Bonus: Tools to Visualize & Explain
	‚Ä¢	PostgreSQL:
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE)
Or use https://explain.dalibo.com/
	‚Ä¢	MySQL:
Use EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON for more structure and detail.
