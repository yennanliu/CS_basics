### üîê The 4 Standard SQL Isolation Levels (from weakest to strongest):

| Isolation Level      | Prevents                                         | Allows                                           | Description                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read Uncommitted** | ‚Äì                                                | Dirty Reads, Non-repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads | Transactions can read **uncommitted changes** from others. Fast but risky.                                    |
| **Read Committed**   | Dirty Reads                                      | Non-repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads              | Only reads **committed data**, but values can **change** if reread. Default in many RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL). |
| **Repeatable Read**  | Dirty Reads, Non-repeatable Reads                | Phantom Reads                                    | Ensures **same values** are read within the same transaction. But new rows may still appear (phantoms).       |
| **Serializable**     | Dirty Reads, Non-repeatable Reads, Phantom Reads | ‚Äì                                                | Transactions are executed as if **serially**, i.e., fully isolated. Most strict & slowest.                    |

### üí• Anomalies Explained:

* **Dirty Read**: Read data that another transaction has written but not committed.
* **Non-Repeatable Read**: Data read once is different when read again in the same transaction.
* **Phantom Read**: A re-executed query returns **new rows** that didn‚Äôt exist earlier in the same transaction.

---

### üß† Real-World Engineering Tips:

* **Default levels differ by database**:

  * PostgreSQL: `Read Committed`
  * MySQL InnoDB: `Repeatable Read`

* **Use higher isolation levels only when necessary**:

  * `Serializable` is expensive; use **optimistic concurrency control** (e.g., versioning) where possible.

* **For idempotency / write conflicts**, consider:

  * `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` (locks row)
  * Application-level retries and conflict resolution

### üîß When to Use Each:

| Use Case                            | Recommended Isolation                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Analytics / Reporting               | Read Committed                                |
| High-concurrency services           | Read Committed / Repeatable Read with retries |
| Financial transactions (e.g., bank) | Repeatable Read / Serializable                |
| Critical inventory, booking systems | Serializable or locking                       |

Certainly! Here's a visual table summarizing the four standard SQL isolation levels and the types of anomalies they prevent, which is crucial for backend engineers working with concurrent transactions.

| **Read Uncommitted** | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes               | ‚úÖ Yes        | Allows reading uncommitted changes from other transactions.                          |
| **Read Committed**   | ‚ùå No       | ‚úÖ Yes               | ‚úÖ Yes        | Only reads committed data; values can change if reread.                              |
| **Repeatable Read**  | ‚ùå No       | ‚ùå No                | ‚úÖ Yes        | Ensures same values are read within the same transaction; new rows may still appear. |

### üí° Key Anomalies Explained

* **Dirty Read**: Reading data that another transaction has written but not yet committed.
* **Non-repeatable Read**: Data read once is different when read again in the same transaction.
* **Phantom Read**: A re-executed query returns new rows that didn't exist earlier in the same transaction.

### üß† Real-World Engineering Tips

* **Default Isolation Levels**:

  * PostgreSQL: `Read Committed`
  * MySQL InnoDB: `Repeatable Read`

* **Use Higher Isolation Levels When Necessary**:

  * `Serializable` is expensive; consider **optimistic concurrency control** (e.g., versioning) where possible.

* **For Idempotency / Write Conflicts**:

  * Use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` (locks row)

Understanding these isolation levels and their implications helps in designing systems that balance performance and data consistency effectively.
