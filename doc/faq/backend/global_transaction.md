 Q: How to Build a Global Transaction?

‚∏ª

üîß 1. Two-Phase Commit (2PC)
	‚Ä¢	A classic method for distributed databases.
	‚Ä¢	Coordinator node manages the commit lifecycle.
	‚Ä¢	Phase 1 ‚Äì Prepare: All participating nodes prepare to commit and report readiness.
	‚Ä¢	Phase 2 ‚Äì Commit: If all succeed, coordinator commits; otherwise, rolls back.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Strong consistency
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Drawback: Blocking and single point of failure; not suited for highly scalable systems.

‚∏ª

üîß 2. Saga Pattern (Modern Microservices)
	‚Ä¢	Preferred in modern microservices and event-driven architectures.
	‚Ä¢	A sequence of local transactions where each service updates its data and publishes an event to trigger the next.
	‚Ä¢	If one step fails, compensating transactions are triggered to undo previous steps.

Example (Booking Flow):
	‚Ä¢	Step 1: Reserve hotel ‚Üí Step 2: Reserve flight ‚Üí Step 3: Charge payment.
	‚Ä¢	If Step 2 fails, Step 1‚Äôs reservation is rolled back by a compensation action.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Frameworks
	‚Ä¢	Orchestration-based Sagas: One central service controls the flow (e.g. Netflix Conductor, Temporal).
	‚Ä¢	Choreography-based Sagas: Services react to events and manage their own transitions (e.g. Apache Kafka + EventBridge).

‚∏ª

üß† Considerations
	‚Ä¢	Ensure idempotency and retry logic in each service.
	‚Ä¢	Use correlation IDs for traceability across systems.
	‚Ä¢	Apply timeouts and circuit breakers for resilience.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary

Choose 2PC for tightly coupled systems needing strong consistency. Use Saga pattern for loosely coupled, scalable microservices where availability and responsiveness are priorities.

‚∏ª



If the Saga Pattern doesn‚Äôt work well for your use case (e.g., due to complexity, limitations in compensation logic, or strict consistency requirements), here are alternative patterns and trade-offs you can consider for global/distributed transactions:

‚∏ª

üîÅ 1. Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

Use case: Strong consistency across distributed services.

‚úÖ Pros:
	‚Ä¢	ACID-compliant across services.
	‚Ä¢	Central coordination (via transaction manager).

‚ùå Cons:
	‚Ä¢	Blocking protocol (can cause lock contention).
	‚Ä¢	Single point of failure (coordinator).
	‚Ä¢	Poor availability in network partitions.
	‚Ä¢	Not scalable for cloud-native/microservices.

‚∏ª

üì® 2. Eventual Consistency with Event-Driven Architecture

Use case: You can tolerate delays in consistency.

‚úÖ Pros:
	‚Ä¢	Asynchronous.
	‚Ä¢	Highly scalable.
	‚Ä¢	Decoupled services.

‚ùå Cons:
	‚Ä¢	Complex failure handling.
	‚Ä¢	Requires idempotent operations.
	‚Ä¢	Difficult to debug / trace.

‚∏ª

üßæ 3. TCC (Try-Confirm-Cancel)

Use case: Resources can be reserved first (e.g., inventory, booking).

‚úÖ Pros:
	‚Ä¢	Fine-grained control over operations.
	‚Ä¢	Explicit compensation model.

‚ùå Cons:
	‚Ä¢	All services must implement try/confirm/cancel logic.
	‚Ä¢	Higher implementation complexity.

‚∏ª

üß© 4. Reliable Messaging + Outbox Pattern

Use case: Ensure event/message delivery in a transactional way.

‚úÖ Pros:
	‚Ä¢	Ensures atomicity between DB and message.
	‚Ä¢	Decouples services.

‚ùå Cons:
	‚Ä¢	Requires additional infrastructure (Kafka, Debezium, etc).
	‚Ä¢	Higher ops/infra overhead.

‚∏ª

üõë 5. Local Transactions + Manual Reconciliation

Use case: Tolerate inconsistency, later fix issues (e.g., billing).

‚úÖ Pros:
	‚Ä¢	Simplest to implement.
	‚Ä¢	Lightweight.

‚ùå Cons:
	‚Ä¢	Data inconsistency risk.
	‚Ä¢	Requires human/auto reconciliation tools.

üí° Choosing the Right Approach

Requirement	Best Fit
Strong consistency needed	2PC, TCC
High scalability	Saga, Outbox
Resource reservation needed	TCC
Resilience to failure	Saga, Outbox
Simplicity > Consistency	Manual Reconciliation
